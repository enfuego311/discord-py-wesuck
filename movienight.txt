I can't make it
Looking forward to it
What movie are we doing?
We will see, I currently have a head cold and haven't slept in 38 hours and Myna is throwing up
I am currently throwing up while typing this
I am currently typing this by throwing up
I will be 5 minutes late as I am cleaning up cat vomit off of the floor
Bad news, I am bleeding from my eyeballs and only hear tongues when people speak so I won't be able to make it tonight
The kids are put to bed, Amanda is busy on her phone, and my microphone is strapped to my head with a rubber band
I can't make it for reasons unspecified
I love movie night
Bro, movie night
Wouldn't miss it for the world
Wouldn't miss it for the world. Not this one, at least
I wants it
I needs it
I'm busy
I want join but I gotta call out tonight - been fighting the puke party all day
Movie night? My place or yours?
Who has time to watch a movie when I only want to watch you
Who has time to watch a movie when I only want to watch you from the bushes
Your timing is on fleek
Movie night is a big mood
*Our* movie night, comrade
Yeet
Cowabunga!
