Dear Diary, Mood: Apathetic
My life is spiraling downward
I couldn't get enough money
To go to the Blood Red Romance
And Suffocate Me Dry concert
It sucks 'cause they play
Some of my favorite songs like
Stab My Heart, Because I Love You
And Rip Apart My Soul
And of course Stabby, Rip, Stab, Stab
And it doesn't help that I couldn't
Get my hair do that flippy thing either
Like that guy from that band could do.
I'm an emo kid, non-conforming as can be
You'd be non-conforming too if you looked just like me
I have paint on my nails and make-up on my face
I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs
'Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag
I call it freedom of expression, most just call me a fag
'Cause our dudes look like chicks and our chicks look like dikes
'Cause emo is one step below transvestite
I'm dark, and sensitive with low self-esteem
The way I dress makes everyday feel like Halloween
I have no real problems but I like to make-believe
I stole my sister's mascara and now I'm grounded for a week
Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies
I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing
Girls keep breaking up with me
It's never any fun
They say they already have a pussy
They don't need another one
Stop my breathing and slit my throat
I must be emo
I don't jump around when I go to shows
I must be emo
Dye in my hair and polish on my toes
I play guitar and write suicide notes
My life is just a black abyss
You know? It's so dark
And it's suffocating me
Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip
Tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans.
Which look great on me, by the way
When I get depressed I cut my wrists in every direction
Hearing songs about getting dumped give me an erection
I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses
I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during classes
I'm just a bad, cheap, imitation of goth
You could read me Catcher In The Rye and watch me jack-off
I wear skin tight clothes while hating my life
If I said I like girls I'd only be half right
I look like I'm dead and dress like a homo
Screw Xbox I play old school Nintendo
I like to whine and hit my parentals
I am always excited
Penis
I must be emo
Me and my friends all look like clones
I must be emo
My parents don't get me, you know?
They think I'm gay just because they saw me kiss a guy
Well, a couple of guys
But I mean, it's the 2000's, can't two, or four dudes
Make out with each other without being gay?
I mean chicks dig that kind of thing anyways
I don't know, Diary, sometimes I think
You're the only one on that gets me
You're my best friend
I love you, you love me
We're a happy family
With a great big hug
And a kiss from me to you
Won't you say you love me too?
We're best friends like friends should be
I love tacos
I love pizza
