Dear Diary, Mood: Apathetic
My life is spiraling downward
I couldn't get enough money
To go to the Blood Red Romance
And Suffocate Me Dry concert
It sucks 'cause they play
Some of my favorite songs like
Stab My Heart, Because I Love You
And Rip Apart My Soul
And of course Stabby, Rip, Stab, Stab
And it doesn't help that I couldn't
Get my hair do that flippy thing either
Like that guy from that band could do.
I'm an emo kid, non-conforming as can be
You'd be non-conforming too if you looked just like me
I have paint on my nails and make-up on my face
I'm almost emo enough to start shaving my legs
'Cause I feel real deep when I'm dressing in drag
I call it freedom of expression, most just call me a fag
'Cause our dudes look like chicks and our chicks look like dikes
'Cause emo is one step below transvestite
I'm dark, and sensitive with low self-esteem
The way I dress makes everyday feel like Halloween
I have no real problems but I like to make-believe
I stole my sister's mascara and now I'm grounded for a week
Sulking and writing poetry are my hobbies
I can't get through a Hawthorne Heights album without sobbing
Girls keep breaking up with me
It's never any fun
They say they already have a pussy
They don't need another one
Stop my breathing and slit my throat
I must be emo
Penis
I don't jump around when I go to shows
Dye in my hair and polish on my toes
I play guitar and write suicide notes
My life is just a black abyss
You know? It's so dark
And it's suffocating me
Grabbing a hold of me and tightening its grip
Tighter than a pair of my little sister's jeans.
Which look great on me, by the way
When I get depressed I cut my wrists in every direction
Hearing songs about getting dumped give me an erection
I write in a live journal and wear thick rimmed glasses
I tell my friends I bleed black and cry during classes
I'm just a bad, cheap, imitation of goth
You could read me Catcher In The Rye and watch me jack-off
I wear skin tight clothes while hating my life
If I said I like girls I'd only be half right
I look like I'm dead and dress like a homo
Screw Xbox I play old school Nintendo
I like to whine and hit my parentals
I am always excited
I don't see myself here in five years
Me and my friends all look like clones
My parents don't get me, you know?
They think I'm gay just because they saw me kiss a guy
Well, a couple of guys
But I mean, it's the 2000's, can't two, or four dudes
Make out with each other without being gay?
I mean chicks dig that kind of thing anyways
I don't know, Diary, sometimes I think
You're the only one on that gets me
You're my best friend
I love you, you love me
We're a happy family
Nice
With a great big hug
And a kiss from me to you
Won't you say you love me too?
We're best friends like friends should be
I love tacos
I love pizza
Winners Don't Do Drugs
So the question is, how low do I go to eat a Sheba single?
I don't cuss when I'm actually upset
If I was in a room with Hitler, Stalin, and Mao, and had a gun with two bullets, I would shoot myself twice
So sick of the hobos
Always begging for change
I don't like how I gotta work
And they just sit around and get paid
I hate all of the people
Who can't drive their cars
Bitch, you better get out of the way
Before I start falling apart
I hate how my wife
Is always up my ass
She always wants to buy brand new things
But I don't have the cash
I hate my job, all of my rich friends
I hate everyone to the bitter end
Nothing turns out right, there's no end in sight
I hate my life
How come I never get laid?
Nice guys always lose
How could she have another headache?
There's always some kind of excuse
I still hate my job, my boss is a dick
I don't get paid nearly enough to put up with all of his shit
I hate that I can't tell
When a girl's underage
You know, I tell her she's a nice piece of ass
Then her daddy punches me in the face
So, if you're pissed like me
This is what you gotta do
Put your middle fingers up in the air
So much at stake, can't catch a break
No, it's nothing new
Hear "it sucks to be you"
